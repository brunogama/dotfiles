    * **Important Payment Note** : Due to requirements of our payment processor (Stripe), the final amount payable **after applying all discounts and Credits must be at least 0.50 USD**. If the discount reduces the payable amount below 0.50 USD, the discount applied may be adjusted to ensure the minimum payment threshold is met.

4. Important Notes & Risk Warnings
  * **Validity Criteria & Single Account Principle**:
    * The **sole criterion** for a valid invitation is: The friend registers via the Inviter‚Äôs **unique invitation link or code** and completes the first subscription payment without refund within the campaign period.
    * **Single Account Principle** : Each natural person may only use **one platform account** to participate. The Platform determines user identity based on multiple factors including **phone number, email address, device ID (e.g., IMEI/OAID/IMSI), IP address, etc. The same phone number, device, payment account, or network environment may be deemed the same user**.
    * The Platform‚Äôs backend system records are the **sole and final basis** for determining invitation relationships, validity, and user identity. In case of discrepancy with user records, the system records prevail.
    * If you have objections regarding invitation records or Credits issuance, please contact customer service within **15 days** of the objection arising for investigation. Objections raised after this period will be considered waived.
  * **User Information Authorization & Privacy**:
    * To facilitate invitation tracking, Credits distribution, and anti-fraud checks, you understand and authorize the Platform to process necessary account and information (e.g., account ID, registration time, device info, payment info) for you and your friends within the scope of this campaign.
    * The Platform will strictly adhere to its privacy policy to protect all users‚Äô personal information. Invitation relationship information will not be disclosed to third parties without user consent.
  * **Violations & Penalties**:
    * Users must comply with the Platform‚Äôs User Agreement, Terms of Service, Subscription Agreement, Top-Up Agreement, campaign rules, etc. **Any form of cheating, fraud, or disruption is strictly prohibited** , including but not limited to:
    * **Technical Cheating** : Using plugins, scripts, emulators, virtual location software, hacker tools, automated scripts, bulk registration tools, etc., to fake invitations, registrations, payments, or tamper with device/network data.
    * **False Info & Account Trading**: Using false information for registration/verification, infringing on third-party rights, buying/selling platform accounts.
    * **Artificial Engagement** : Paying for services, joining booster groups, or exchanging non-genuine social engagements to complete tasks.
    * **Disruption** : Launching network attacks, exploiting loopholes, bypassing security measures, or any activity disrupting normal platform operations.
    * **Account Association** : If any account is found involved in fraud/cheating, we reserve the right to **disqualify all associated accounts** from the campaign and **reclaim all rewards** earned through those accounts based on reasonable judgment.
    * **Penalties** : If users are found violating these rules per our risk control systems or reasonable judgment, we may take one or more actions **without prior notice** :
    * **Deduct** all issued but unused Credits; **Reclaim the cash value** of any consumed Credits.
    * **Restrict, freeze, or permanently ban** violating accounts.
    * **Permanently prohibit** violating and associated accounts from all current and future Platform campaigns and benefits.
    * **Reserve the right to claim compensation** for all direct/indirect losses caused (e.g., extra operational costs, reputational damage, recovery costs) and **report to authorities**.
    * **Pursue legal liability** for severe cases involving significant amounts or illegal activities.
  * **Campaign Changes, Suspension, & Termination**:
    * We reserve the right to **adjust, pause, or terminate** this campaign early based on actual operations, laws, regulations, or force majeure, announced via our website, in-app messages, or other reasonable means. Users may not hold the Platform liable for such actions.
  * **Final Interpretation Right** :
    * **To the extent permitted by law** , Z.ai Platform reserves the **final right to interpret** all terms, details, and reward distributions related to this campaign. We have the right to make final judgments on unforeseen circumstances or ambiguities in a **fair, reasonable manner consistent with the campaign‚Äôs purpose**.

**If you have any questions about these rules, please contact our customer service. Thank you for your participation!**
