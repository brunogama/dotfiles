How does cache works in GLM-4.5?
The caching mechanism is currently undergoing open beta testing. Therefore, the underlying logic of the caching mechanism (including but not limited to: how cache hits are triggered, how long cached content is retained, etc.) has not yet been announced. A part of your request content may be cached on our cloud platform, and the storage of cached content is currently completely free. During the request process, if your request triggers a cache hit, the cached content will be calculated at 1/5 of the original price.

Why hasnâ€™t my account balance changed after I used the API?
  * Please be advised that there is currently a processing delay in our billing system. You do not need to worry too much if you see your account balance kept the same after using api port.
  * The billing history reflect daily consumption records, and therefore display the billing status from the previous day (n-1).
  * Current day consumption will not be immediately visible in the billing details.
