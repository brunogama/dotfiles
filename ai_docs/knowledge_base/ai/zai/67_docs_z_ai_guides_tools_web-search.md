Web Search API
Web Search API is a search engine specifically designed for large language models. Building on the traditional capabilities of webpage crawling and ranking, it enhances intent recognition and returns results that are more suitable for LLM processing (webpage titles, URLs, summaries, site names, and favicons).
  1. Intent-Enhanced Retrieval: Intelligently identifies the userâ€™s query intent and automatically determines whether web search is needed.
  2. Structured Output: Returns data formats optimized for LLMs, including titles, URLs, summaries, site names, and icons.
  3. Customizable Search Scope: Allows developers to specify the number of results, domain constraints, and time ranges. It also supports adjustable summary lengths for fine-grained search behavior control.
  4. Time-Aware Output Control: The response can include the webpageâ€™s publication time, facilitating timeliness analysis and result ranking.

      "content": "According to Zhitong Finance APP, Macao's Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.23% year-on-year and 0.16% month-on-month in April 2025. The data, released by Macao's Statistics and Census Service on May 23, reflects subtle shifts in Macao's consumer market.\n1. Changes in Macao's CPI\nData shows that the 12-month average composite CPI as of April 2025 rose 0.42% compared to the same period a year earlier (May 2023â€“April 2024). Among major categories, the price index for Recreation, Sports, and Culture rose 2.47% year-on-year, while Miscellaneous Goods and Services increased 1.82%, signaling potential economic recovery.\n2. Impact of Food and Rent\nFood and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose 0.48% year-on-year, driven by higher dining-out and takeaway costs. Housing and fuel prices also increased 0.21% due to rising rents. As tourism recovers, dining demand has pushed up service fees.\nHowever, prices for Communication (-3.01%), Clothing (-2.35%), and Transport (-1.67%) declined, complicating the overall CPI trend.\n3. Month-on-Month Changes\nCompared to March 2025, April's CPI rose 0.16%. Recreation, Sports, and Culture saw the largest increase (2.6%) due to higher hotel rates. Summer clothing launches and rebounding airfares also lifted Clothing (+0.78%) and Transport (+0.42%) prices.\nDespite this, Food and non-alcoholic beverages dipped slightly (-0.04%) as lower prices for fresh fish, seafood, vegetables, and fruit offset higher dining costs.\n4. CPI Classification\nMacao's CPI is compiled into three series to reflect price impacts on households with different spending patterns. Category A (50% of households) covers monthly expenditures of 11,000â€“35,999 MOP, while Category B (30%) covers 36,000â€“71,999 MOP.\nHousing and fuel (34.47%), food (29.47%), and transport (8.33%) carry the highest weights, ensuring precise reflection of consumption trends across income groups.\n5. Outlook\nMacao's consumer market will continue to face multiple influences. While some categories show price declines, the overall mild CPI rise suggests recovery potential. With tourism rebounding and demand growing, CPI may maintain a gradual upward trend.\nIn summary, April 2025's CPI changes reflect market dynamics and new cost-of-living challenges. Authorities must monitor price impacts to craft effective policies ensuring stable living standards. Return to Sohu for more.",

April 16, 2025, will witness a series of highly anticipated financial activities and important data releases, forming a focal point for investors and stirring the nerves of international markets.\n1. Market Volatility and Investor Expectations\nRecently, global markets have faced numerous uncertainties, particularly regarding inflation, interest rate policies, and the winding path of economic recovery, all of which have immersed investors in a sea of analysis and predictions.\nOn April 16, the U.S., Europe, China, and other regions will release a series of heavyweight economic data, which investors eagerly anticipate. These data may provide crucial clues for future market trends. Just as every fluctuation in the stock market is a process of information transmission, only by deeply understanding this information can one make more effective investment decisions.\n2.

      "content": "As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, adjustments in macroeconomic policies and data releases by various countries are having a profound impact on the market. On April 14, 2025, multiple important financial events and data will emerge, which not only relate to the health of national economies but may also trigger chain reactions in global markets. This article provides a detailed analysis of the day's major financial events, offering deep insights for readers.\n1. Introduction to Market Phenomena: The Fluid Changes in the Global Economic Landscape\nIn recent years, the global economic situation has been highly volatile, with financial markets reacting sensitively. The economic data for Q1 2025 is about to be released, and its impact on foreign exchange, stock, and commodity markets cannot be underestimated. Especially amid the mutual influences of major economies like China, the U.S., and Europe, market investors are increasingly focusing on real-time data and changes in economic policies.\n2. State Council Information Office Releases Q1 Import and Export Data\nTime: 10:00\nChina's State Council Information Office will hold a press conference to release Q1 import and export data. This information is not just about numbers but also reveals the close ties between China and the global economic chain. The growth or decline in import and export data will directly affect GDP growth expectations, thereby influencing investor confidence.\nBy analyzing recent trade relations, it is evident that China plays a pivotal role in the global supply chain. Especially in the face of international economic fluctuations, China's import and export situation will serve as a market barometer, closely linked to trends in international commodity prices and the foreign exchange market. Achieving strong import and export performance will not only boost market confidence but also inject more vitality into domestic economic development.\n3. Canadian Wholesale Sales Data and Economic Analysis\nTime: 20:30\nOn the same day, Canada will release its February wholesale sales monthly rate data. Wholesale sales are an important indicator of retail demand expectations, directly reflecting the health of the economy.\nAnalysts point out that if the data shows strong sales growth, it may indicate a recovery in Canadian consumer confidence, while the opposite would suggest potential economic risks. Particularly during a rate hike cycle, changes in consumer spending will be especially important, influencing the Bank of Canada's monetary policy decisions and, to some extent, global market liquidity.\n4. Importance of U.S. Inflation Expectations\nTime: 23:00\nNext, the New York Fed will release the one-year inflation expectations data for March. This data is a key reference for assessing U.S. consumers' and businesses' views on future economic conditions.\nCurrently, the Fed is at a crossroads in addressing high inflation and reducing interest rate pressures. Rising inflation expectations may signal the need for further rate hikes, affecting capital market pricing. Conversely, if inflation shows signs of easing, it would indicate that policies are taking effect, potentially boosting market risk appetite.\n5. OPEC Crude Oil Market Report: A Barometer for Energy Prices\nTime: To be determined\nAround the same time, OPEC will release its monthly crude oil market report. This report typically influences global crude oil price trends.\nÂ·\nExpand full text\nIn 2025, global energy agencies are generally facing the dual challenges of balancing market supply and demand with emission reduction policies. As global warming issues intensify, the balance between new energy development and traditional energy consumption in various countries will become increasingly important. Especially for countries reliant on oil and gas resources, this report will be a key reference for observing market adjustments.\n6. Views from Fed Officials: A Critical Moment for Market Interpretation\nTime: 00:00 and 06:00 the next day\nFed officials will deliver speeches on navigating economic uncertainties and sharing the Fed's role. These speeches will not only outline the future direction of Fed policy but also cast a shadow over economic uncertainties.\nThe market's focus on the Fed will influence global investor expectations, especially under the current intertwined scenarios of high inflation and high interest rates. Investors need to closely monitor the Fed's stance, which will not only affect the dollar's trajectory but also directly relate to the stability of commodity markets and the global financial system.\nConclusion: Financial Signals Investors Cannot Ignore\nIn summary, the major financial events and economic data on April 14, 2025, herald new changes in the global economy, warranting close attention from investors. On this day, the release of economic data and policy interpretations will intertwine, forming a barometer for market trends.\nWhile the global economy remains uncertain, investors must stay vigilant, monitor real-time information changes, and respond promptly. At the same time, diversifying investments and controlling risks will be wise choices to cope with market fluctuations. How to find stable investment opportunities in a changing economic environment is a crucial question every investor must consider.\nFinally, we hope that under the impetus of these financial events and data, a clearer and more stable development environment can emerge. Let us stay tuned and seize every possible opportunity. Return to Sohu for more.",
