1. Fees and Billing
  * Access to certain Z.ai services or features may require payment. Applicable fees are listed on the **Z.ai** , unless otherwise communicated in writing.
  * To purchase services, you must provide complete and accurate billing information (‚ÄúPayment Method‚Äù). You authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the applicable fees and any taxes.
  * If you subscribe through a third-party distributor (e.g., an app store), your payment, billing, and refund terms are governed by the distributor‚Äôs policies.
  * Except where required by law or explicitly stated, all payments are **non-refundable**. Please review your order carefully before confirming.

2. Subscriptions and Renewal
  * Some services are available by subscription (‚ÄúSubscription‚Äù). The scope, features, and duration of your Subscription will be described during checkout. Z.ai may update the content or features from time to time.
  * Paid Subscriptions **renew automatically** at the end of each subscription term, and your Payment Method will be charged for the renewal term, unless you cancel.
  * If your Subscription has an initial minimum term (‚ÄúInitial Term‚Äù), it will automatically renew for the same duration (‚ÄúRenewal Term‚Äù) unless canceled.
  * You may cancel your Subscription at any time using the tools provided by Z.ai. If purchased through a distributor, cancellation must follow the distributor‚Äôs process.
  * To avoid renewal charges, cancel at least **24 hours before the end of the current term**. Cancellation does not entitle you to a refund, but you will continue to have access until the end of the paid term.

3. Fee Changes
  * Z.ai may adjust Subscription fees from time to time but will not increase fees during your current term.
  * If fees are increased, you will be notified in advance. Continuing the Subscription after renewal constitutes acceptance of the new fees.

4. Usage Rules
  * During your use, you should comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and industry standards.

  * You shall comply with Terms of Use, Service Agreements, usage rules and other relevant agreements of Z.ai.
  * Violation of this agreement may result in the suspension or termination of services, and paid fees will not be refunded.

5. Limitation of Liability
  * Z.ai shall exert reasonable efforts to ensure the stability and security of the subscription service. However, Z.ai **does not warrant** that the service will be entirely error-free or meet your expectations. Z.ai **shall not be liable** for service interruptions caused by **force majeure** , network failures, or third-party actions.

[‚Äã](https://docs.z.ai/legal-agreement/subscription-terms#6-other-terms)
