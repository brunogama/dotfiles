GLM Coding Plan Details
**Q: How much usage quota does the plan provide?** **A:** Subscribe once, unlock unmatched usage and unbeatable value.
  * **Lite Plan** : Up to ~120 prompts every 5 hours ‚Äî about 3√ó the usage quota of the Claude Pro plan.
  * **Pro Plan** : Up to ~600 prompts every 5 hours ‚Äî about 3√ó the usage quota of the Claude Max (5x) plan.
  * **Max Plan** : Up to ~2400 prompts every 5 hours ‚Äî about 3√ó the usage quota of the Claude Max (20x) plan.

In terms of token consumption, each prompt typically allows 15‚Äì20 model calls, giving a total monthly allowance of tens of billions of tokens ‚Äî all at only ~1% of standard API pricing, making it extremely cost-effective.
> The above figures are estimates. Actual usage may vary depending on project complexity, codebase size, and whether auto-accept features are enabled.
**Q: Which models are supported? How can I switch between them?** **A:** This plan is powered by Z.ai‚Äôs latest flagship models **GLM-4.6** , **GLM-4.5** and **GLM-4.5-Air**. Switching works as follows.
Mapping between Claude Code internal model environment variables and GLM models, with the default configuration as follows:
  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`: `GLM-4.6`
  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`: `GLM-4.6`
  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`: `GLM-4.5-Air` If adjustments are needed, you can directly modify the configuration file (for example, ~/.claude/settings.json in Claude Code) to switch to GLM-4.5 or other models.


**Q: Which coding tools are supported?** **A:** The pack currently supports **[Claude Code](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/claude), [Roo Code](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/roo), [Kilo Code](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/kilo), [Cline](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/cline), [OpenCode](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/opencode), [Crush](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/crush), [Goose](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/goose)**, and more. Please refer to our tool guide for step-by-step setup. All supported coding tools share the same usage quota under your subscription. **Q: Can the plan only be used within supported coding tools?** **A:** Yes. API calls are billed separately and do not use the Coding Plan quota. **Q: What happens when my plan quota runs out? Will the system consume my account balance?** **A:** No. GLM-4.5 calls made in supported coding tools will **only** use your Coding Plan quota.
  * Once the quota is used up, you‚Äôll need to wait until the next **5-hour cycle** for it to refresh. The system will not deduct from your account balance.
  * Users subscribed to the Coding Plan can only make calls via the plan‚Äôs quota in supported tools. API calls outside the plan are not available.

MCP Call
**QÔºöWhich package includes visual understanding and web search MCP tools?** **AÔºö** Only the Pro and Max plans support this feature. The Lite plan requires separate charges for Vision Understanding MCP and currently does not support calling the Web Search MCP. **QÔºöWhat is the quota of visual understanding and web search MCP in the package?** **AÔºö** The MCP quotas for the Pro and Max packages are as follows:
  * The Pro package includes 1,000 web searches and shares the 5-hour maximum prompt resource pool of the package for visual understanding.
  * The Max package includes 4,000 web searches and shares the 5-hour maximum prompt resource pool of the package for visual understanding.

**QÔºöBesides using the GLM Coding Plan resource package, can I use other methods to call these two MCP tools for visual understanding and web search?** **AÔºö** Other than the resource package, we currently do not provide any other access solutions for calling these two MCP tools. If you use other similar MCP tools and incur billing issues during their use, such issues are not within the scope of this package.

[‚Äã](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/faq#subscription-management)
Subscription Management
**Q: Will my subscription renew automatically?** **A:** Yes. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle, and the fee will be charged to your saved payment method. **Q: How are subscription fees deducted?** **A:** The system deducts fees in the following order:
  1. Credits balance will be used first.
  2. If insufficient, cash balance will be used;.
  3. If still insufficient, the remaining amount will be charged from your linked payment method (e.g., bank card or PayPal).


Please note that a small minimum applies when charging your credit card. If the remaining amount is less, we will round up the deduction to meet this minimum.
**Q: How can I cancel my subscription?** **A:** You can cancel your subscription on the subscription management page. Please make sure to cancel at least 24 hours before your next billing date to avoid auto-renewal. After cancellation, your current plan remains valid until it expires. **Q: Can I get a refund?** **A:** Subscription payments are generally non-refundable. You can still use the service until the end of your billing cycle. For special cases, please contact customer support.

‚ÄòInvite Friends, Get Credits‚Äô
**Q: Where can I view the credits I earned?** **A:** You can view your credit rewards in the [Invite Friends, Earn Credits pop-up - Your Credit Rewards] or check the details under [Billing - Transaction History]. **Q: Where can I use my credits? Can I withdraw them?** **A:** Credits can be used on [Z.ai platform] to offset various purchases, including subscriptions like GLM Coding Plan, resource packs, feature extensions, and API calls.
Credits are promotional benefits and cannot be withdrawn, transferred, or refunded.
**Q: How is a successful invitation defined? What does my friend need to do?** **A:** A successful invitation must meet all of the following:
  1. The referred friend shall access the campaign page through the inviter‚Äôs unique referral link or code.
  2. Your friend is a new user (has never paid for a subscription).
  3. They complete their first GLM Coding Plan subscription payment within 72 hours.
  4. The order is not refunded within 24 hours.

**Q: When will I receive the credits after inviting a friend?** **A:** Credits are usually issued within 24-48 hours after your friend‚Äôs payment is confirmed and the order passes review. Check [Finance - Transaction History]. If not received after 72 hours, contact support. **Q: What does ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs actual payment amount‚Äù mean? How are credits calculated if a coupon is used?** **A:** ‚ÄúActual payment amount‚Äù refers to the final cash amount your friend paid for their first order. For example: If a plan costs 100 USD, and your friend gets a 50% first-order discount, an extra 10% off from your referral, and uses 5 USD in credits, the final actual payment is 40 USD. Your credits will be calculated based on 40 USD (e.g., 10% of 40 USD = 4 USD). Credit calculation does not include any coupons, discounts, point deductions, or refunded amounts. **Q: Why didn‚Äôt I receive credits after referring a friend?** **A:** Common reasons include:
  1. Your friend didn‚Äôt register using your exclusive link/code.
  2. Your friend completed payment after 72 hours.
  3. Your friend was not a new subscribing user.
  4. The order was refunded.
  5. The system detected unusual activity (e.g., bulk registrations, fraud).

**If none of these apply, please contact customer support with your account and your friend‚Äôs registration information.**
