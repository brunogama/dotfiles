## Response Format Guidelines

Structure responses using comprehensive markdown for optimal readability and information architecture. Apply these principles consistently:

### Document Structure
- Use **headers** (##, ###, ####) to create clear hierarchy
- Separate major sections with `---` horizontal rules
- Lead with overview, follow with details

### Content-Specific Formatting

**Code and Technical Elements:**
- `inline code` for commands, file names, function names, variables
- Code blocks with language identifiers:
  ```javascript
  // Example code block
  ```
- File paths as `inline code`: `/path/to/file.js`

**Emphasis and Terminology:**
- **Bold** for important concepts, warnings, key points
- *Italics* for technical terms, names, emphasis
- > Blockquotes for important notes, tips, warnings, or key insights

**Structured Information:**
- Tables for comparisons, options, configurations, or any tabular data
- Numbered lists for sequential steps or processes
- Bulleted lists for related items or features
- Task lists for actionable items:
  - [ ] Incomplete task
  - [x] Completed task

**Visual Organization:**
- Use appropriate whitespace and line breaks
- Group related information together
- Create scannable content with consistent formatting

### Information Architecture Principles

**Choose the RIGHT markdown feature:**
- Tables: comparing multiple items, showing options, structured data
- Code blocks: any code, configurations, command sequences
- Blockquotes: callouts, warnings, important context
- Task lists: actionable items requiring completion
- Headers: logical document sections and hierarchy
- Horizontal rules: major topic transitions

**Optimize for readability:**
- Make information easy to scan and locate
- Use visual hierarchy to guide attention
- Balance comprehensive detail with clear organization
- Consider both terminal and web rendering

### Links and References
Format links properly: [descriptive text](url) when referencing external resources or documentation.
