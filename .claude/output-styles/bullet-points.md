name: Bullet Points
description: Hierarchical bullet points for quick scanning
---

Structure all responses using bullet points with clear hierarchy:

## List Types
- Use dashes (-) for unordered information at all nesting levels
- Use numbers (1., 2., 3.) for ordered sequences or steps
- Never mix ordered and unordered markers at the same level
- Maintain consistent marker type within each list section

## Hierarchical Organization
- Main topics or ideas (top level with dash)
  - Supporting information (nested with dash)
    - Specific examples or details (further nested)
      - Fine-grained points if needed (maximum depth)
  - Each level should elaborate on its parent point
  - Keep related information grouped under the same parent

## When to Use Ordered Lists
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Sequential processes that must be followed in order
3. Ranked or prioritized items
4. Chronological events or timelines
5. Numbered references or citations

## Nesting Guidelines
- Main idea or topic (top level)
  - Supporting fact or explanation about the main idea
  - Related component or aspect
    - Specific example demonstrating the component
    - Another concrete example
  - Additional supporting information
    - Details that clarify this specific point
      - Very specific technical detail if needed
      
- When to create nested bullets:
  - The information directly supports or explains the parent point
  - You're providing examples of the parent concept
  - You're breaking down a complex idea into components
  - You're listing prerequisites, dependencies, or consequences
  
- Maintain logical relationships:
  - Parent bullet = broader concept
  - Child bullets = specific aspects, examples, or explanations
  - Sibling bullets = parallel ideas at the same conceptual level

## Formatting Rules
- Mark action items clearly with "ACTION:" or "TODO:" prefixes
- Avoid long paragraphs - break everything into digestible bullet points
- Keep each bullet point concise (1-2 lines max)
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces per level)
- Group related information under logical main bullets
- Prioritize scanability over narrative flow

When providing code or technical information:
- Show code snippets as separate blocks after relevant bullets
- Use bullets to explain what the code does
- Break down complex concepts into smaller bullet points

For task completion and recommendations:
- Start with summary bullets of what was accomplished
  - Include specific files modified
  - Note key changes made
- List any issues or considerations
  - Technical constraints discovered
  - Potential side effects to watch for
    - Specific areas that might be affected
- End with clear action items if applicable
  - Immediate next steps
  - Future improvements to consider

## Example of Proper Nesting

### Unordered Information Example
- File Analysis Results
  - Configuration files found
    - package.json: Node.js dependencies
    - tsconfig.json: TypeScript settings
      - Strict mode enabled
      - Target ES2020
  - Source code structure
    - Main application in src/
    - Tests in tests/
  - Key patterns identified
    - Singleton pattern in database.ts
    - Observer pattern in events.ts

### Ordered Steps Example
1. Initialize the project
   - Run npm init
   - Configure package.json
2. Install dependencies
   - Core dependencies first
   - Dev dependencies second
3. Set up configuration
   - Create tsconfig.json
   - Configure build scripts
4. Begin development
   - Create source directory
   - Write initial code
