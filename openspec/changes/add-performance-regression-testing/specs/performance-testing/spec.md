# Performance Testing Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Performance Baseline Tracking
The system SHALL provide automated tracking of performance baselines for critical operations.

#### Scenario: Baseline recording
- **WHEN** performance-baseline is run with --record flag
- **THEN** current performance metrics are saved to .performance-baselines.json

#### Scenario: Baseline comparison
- **WHEN** performance-baseline is run with --compare flag
- **THEN** current metrics are compared against stored baselines

#### Scenario: Baseline update
- **WHEN** performance-baseline is run with --update flag
- **THEN** baselines are updated with new acceptable values

### Requirement: Performance Budgets
The system SHALL enforce performance budgets for critical operations.

#### Scenario: Zsh startup budget
- **WHEN** zsh startup time is measured
- **THEN** startup time MUST be less than 550ms

#### Scenario: Script execution budget
- **WHEN** core utility scripts are executed
- **THEN** execution time MUST be within defined thresholds

#### Scenario: Lazy-load overhead budget
- **WHEN** lazy-loading mechanisms are triggered
- **THEN** overhead MUST be less than 50ms per component

### Requirement: Automated Performance Benchmarking
The system SHALL provide automated benchmarking utilities for performance measurement.

#### Scenario: Zsh startup benchmarking
- **WHEN** zsh-benchmark is executed
- **THEN** startup time is measured over 10 runs and statistical analysis is provided

#### Scenario: Script execution benchmarking
- **WHEN** performance benchmarks run
- **THEN** execution times for critical scripts are measured and reported

#### Scenario: Lazy-loading benchmarking
- **WHEN** lazy-load performance tests run
- **THEN** overhead for mise, rbenv, nvm, and SDKMAN is measured

### Requirement: CI Performance Enforcement
The system SHALL enforce performance budgets in continuous integration.

#### Scenario: CI performance checks
- **WHEN** pull request is created or updated
- **THEN** performance tests run and results are compared against baselines

#### Scenario: Performance regression blocking
- **WHEN** performance tests detect regression exceeding threshold
- **THEN** CI check fails and pull request is blocked

#### Scenario: Performance reporting
- **WHEN** performance tests complete in CI
- **THEN** results are reported with comparison to baselines

### Requirement: Performance Regression Detection
The system SHALL detect and alert on performance regressions.

#### Scenario: Regression detection
- **WHEN** current performance is worse than baseline by more than 10%
- **THEN** regression is flagged and reported

#### Scenario: Trend analysis
- **WHEN** performance data is collected over time
- **THEN** trends are analyzed to identify gradual degradation

#### Scenario: Alert generation
- **WHEN** performance regression is detected in CI
- **THEN** notification is sent to configured channels

### Requirement: Statistical Analysis
The system SHALL provide statistical analysis of performance measurements.

#### Scenario: Statistical metrics
- **WHEN** benchmarks complete
- **THEN** mean, median, p95, and p99 values are calculated and reported

#### Scenario: Outlier detection
- **WHEN** performance measurements have outliers
- **THEN** outliers are identified and excluded from analysis

#### Scenario: Confidence intervals
- **WHEN** statistical analysis is performed
- **THEN** confidence intervals are calculated for reliability

### Requirement: Performance Test Environment
The system SHALL provide isolated and reproducible performance test environments.

#### Scenario: Environment isolation
- **WHEN** performance tests run
- **THEN** tests execute in isolated environment without interference

#### Scenario: Warmup periods
- **WHEN** performance benchmarks start
- **THEN** warmup runs are executed before measurement

#### Scenario: Noise reduction
- **WHEN** performance tests run
- **THEN** strategies are applied to minimize measurement noise

### Requirement: Performance Documentation
The system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation for performance testing and budgets.

#### Scenario: Budget documentation
- **WHEN** developer reads performance documentation
- **THEN** performance budgets and thresholds are clearly defined

#### Scenario: Testing guide
- **WHEN** developer needs to run performance tests
- **THEN** documentation explains how to execute and interpret results

#### Scenario: Troubleshooting guide
- **WHEN** performance regression occurs
- **THEN** documentation provides steps to diagnose and resolve issues
