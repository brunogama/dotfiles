# Proposal: Intelligent Git Branch Merge Script

## Why

Manual Git branch merging often requires developers to decide between rebasing and merging, leading to inconsistent workflows and potential conflicts. An automated script can analyze the branch state and choose the optimal strategy, improving team efficiency and reducing merge errors.

## What Changes

- Add Python script `bin/git-smart-merge` that intelligently chooses between rebase and merge
- Implement conflict detection using `git rebase --dry-run` simulation
- Fallback to `git merge --no-ff` when conflicts are detected
- Accept source branch name as command-line argument
- Provide comprehensive logging for decision transparency
- Include safety checks for uncommitted changes and remote synchronization

## Impact

- Affected specs: `specs/git-automation/spec.md` (new capability)
- Affected code:
  - New file: `bin/git-smart-merge` (Python CLI script)
  - New file: `tests/test_git_smart_merge.py` (unit tests)
- User experience: Simplifies branch integration workflow
- Breaking changes: None (new utility, no existing dependencies)
