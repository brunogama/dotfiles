# Git Automation Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Intelligent Branch Merge Strategy

The system SHALL automatically determine the optimal Git merge strategy (rebase vs merge) based on conflict detection and branch state analysis.

#### Scenario: Clean rebase with no conflicts
- **WHEN** user runs `git-smart-merge feature-branch` and no merge conflicts exist
- **THEN** the script performs `git rebase feature-branch` successfully
- **AND** logs indicate "Rebase strategy chosen: no conflicts detected"
- **AND** the script exits with code 0

#### Scenario: Conflicting changes require merge
- **WHEN** user runs `git-smart-merge feature-branch` and merge conflicts are detected during analysis
- **THEN** the script performs `git merge --no-ff feature-branch` instead of rebase
- **AND** logs indicate "Merge strategy chosen: conflicts detected, rebase not safe"
- **AND** the script exits with code 0 if merge succeeds

#### Scenario: Merge conflicts prevent completion
- **WHEN** user runs `git-smart-merge feature-branch` and `git merge --no-ff` encounters conflicts
- **THEN** the script logs "Merge failed: manual conflict resolution required"
- **AND** the script exits with code 1
- **AND** the repository remains in merge conflict state for manual resolution

### Requirement: Source Branch Validation

The script SHALL validate the source branch exists and is accessible before attempting any merge operations.

#### Scenario: Valid source branch
- **WHEN** user provides a valid branch name that exists locally or remotely
- **THEN** the script proceeds with conflict detection and merge strategy selection

#### Scenario: Non-existent source branch
- **WHEN** user provides a branch name that doesn't exist locally or remotely
- **THEN** the script logs "Error: Branch 'invalid-branch' not found"
- **AND** the script exits with code 1 without modifying the repository

#### Scenario: Missing command-line argument
- **WHEN** user runs `git-smart-merge` without providing a branch name
- **THEN** the script displays usage help: "Usage: git-smart-merge <source-branch> [options]"
- **AND** the script exits with code 2

### Requirement: Pre-merge Safety Checks

The script SHALL verify repository state is clean and safe before attempting merge operations to prevent data loss.

#### Scenario: Clean working directory
- **WHEN** user has no uncommitted changes in the working directory
- **THEN** the script proceeds with merge strategy analysis

#### Scenario: Uncommitted changes present
- **WHEN** user has uncommitted changes in the working directory
- **THEN** the script logs "Error: Uncommitted changes detected. Commit or stash changes before merging."
- **AND** the script exits with code 1 without attempting merge
- **AND** no changes are made to the repository state

#### Scenario: Remote branch synchronization
- **WHEN** the script begins execution
- **THEN** it fetches latest remote changes with `git fetch` before analysis
- **AND** logs indicate "Fetching latest remote changes..."

### Requirement: Decision Transparency

The script SHALL provide clear logging of decisions, actions, and outcomes to ensure users understand what happened.

#### Scenario: Verbose operation logging
- **WHEN** any merge operation is performed
- **THEN** the script logs each major step:
  - "Checking repository state..."
  - "Fetching remote changes..."
  - "Detecting conflicts..."
  - "Strategy selected: [rebase|merge]"
  - "Executing [rebase|merge]..."
  - "Operation completed successfully" OR "Operation failed: [reason]"

#### Scenario: Conflict detection explanation
- **WHEN** conflicts are detected during analysis
- **THEN** the script logs specific details:
  - "Conflicts detected in files: [list of files]"
  - "Rebase not safe, falling back to merge strategy"

### Requirement: Exit Code Conventions

The script SHALL use standard exit codes to indicate success, user error, or system failure for scripting integration.

#### Scenario: Successful operation
- **WHEN** merge or rebase completes successfully
- **THEN** exit code is 0

#### Scenario: User error
- **WHEN** uncommitted changes exist, invalid arguments provided, or non-existent branch specified
- **THEN** exit code is 1 or 2

#### Scenario: Git operation failure
- **WHEN** Git commands fail (merge conflicts, network errors, permission issues)
- **THEN** exit code is 1
- **AND** error message clearly indicates the failure reason

### Requirement: Optional Operation Modes

The script SHALL support dry-run and force modes to accommodate different user workflows and debugging needs.

#### Scenario: Dry-run mode
- **WHEN** user runs `git-smart-merge feature-branch --dry-run`
- **THEN** the script analyzes and logs which strategy would be used
- **AND** no actual merge or rebase is performed
- **AND** repository state remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Force merge mode
- **WHEN** user runs `git-smart-merge feature-branch --force-merge`
- **THEN** the script skips conflict detection and performs `git merge --no-ff` directly
- **AND** logs indicate "Force merge mode: skipping rebase analysis"

#### Scenario: Force rebase mode
- **WHEN** user runs `git-smart-merge feature-branch --force-rebase`
- **THEN** the script attempts `git rebase` regardless of conflict detection
- **AND** logs indicate "Force rebase mode: attempting rebase without conflict check"
- **AND** if rebase fails, the script exits with code 1 (no fallback to merge)
