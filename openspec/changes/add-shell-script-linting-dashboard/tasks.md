# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Linting Dashboard CLI
- [ ] 1.1 Create `bin/core/lint-dashboard` script
- [ ] 1.2 Add shellcheck integration for all scripts
- [ ] 1.3 Implement issue aggregation across all files
- [ ] 1.4 Add severity classification (error, warning, info)
- [ ] 1.5 Create summary statistics generator

## 2. Quality Metrics
- [ ] 2.1 Define quality metrics (total issues, issues per file, severity distribution)
- [ ] 2.2 Create `tests/quality-metrics.json` schema
- [ ] 2.3 Implement metrics collection
- [ ] 2.4 Add historical metrics tracking
- [ ] 2.5 Calculate quality score

## 3. Unified Linting Summary
- [ ] 3.1 Create summary report generator
- [ ] 3.2 Show top 10 files with most issues
- [ ] 3.3 Show most common issue types
- [ ] 3.4 Display quality score and trend
- [ ] 3.5 Add actionable recommendations

## 4. HTML Report Generation
- [ ] 4.1 Create `scripts/generate-lint-report.sh`
- [ ] 4.2 Design HTML template for report
- [ ] 4.3 Add issue details with file locations
- [ ] 4.4 Include code snippets with issues highlighted
- [ ] 4.5 Add interactive filtering and sorting
- [ ] 4.6 Generate trend charts

## 5. Trend Tracking
- [ ] 5.1 Store historical metrics over time
- [ ] 5.2 Calculate trend direction (improving, degrading, stable)
- [ ] 5.3 Track issues introduced vs fixed
- [ ] 5.4 Generate trend visualization data
- [ ] 5.5 Alert on quality degradation

## 6. CI Integration
- [ ] 6.1 Create `.github/workflows/linting-dashboard.yml`
- [ ] 6.2 Run linting on all shell scripts
- [ ] 6.3 Generate and upload HTML report as artifact
