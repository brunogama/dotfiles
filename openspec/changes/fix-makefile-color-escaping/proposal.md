# Fix Makefile Color Escaping Bug

## Why

The Makefile has a color escaping bug that causes ANSI color codes to not render correctly:

**Current Problems:**
- [NO] Color codes use `\033` which doesn't work with plain `@echo`
- [NO] Colors display as literal text like `\033[0;32m` instead of coloring output
- [NO] `@echo` doesn't interpret escape sequences on all systems
- [NO] Different behavior across macOS versions and shells
- [NO] Makes Makefile help output hard to read

**Impact:**
- Ugly Makefile output with visible escape codes
- Reduced readability of `make help`
- Inconsistent behavior across environments
- Professional appearance diminished

**Root Cause:**
```makefile
BLUE := \033[0;34m
GREEN := \033[0;32m
# ...
@echo "$(GREEN)[OK] Installation complete!$(NC)"
```

The `@echo` command doesn't interpret `\033` escape sequences. Need to use `@echo -e` or `@printf`.

## What Changes

**Fix Color Definitions:**
- Change from `\033` to `\e` (shorter, more compatible)
- OR use `$(shell printf ...)` for guaranteed compatibility
- Update all color variable definitions

**Fix Echo Commands:**
- Change `@echo` to `@printf` for colored output
- Add `\n` to printf statements for line breaks
- Keep `@echo` for non-colored output (faster)

**Recommended Solution: Use printf**
```makefile
# Old (broken)
BLUE := \033[0;34m
@echo "$(BLUE)Text$(NC)"

# New (fixed)
BLUE := \033[0;34m
@printf "$(BLUE)Text$(NC)\n"
```

**Alternative Solution: Use echo -e**
```makefile
# Old (broken)
@echo "$(BLUE)Text$(NC)"

# New (works on most systems)
@echo -e "$(BLUE)Text$(NC)"
```

**Best Solution: Shell-expanded colors**
```makefile
BLUE := $(shell printf '\033[0;34m')
GREEN := $(shell printf '\033[0;32m')
# ...
@echo "$(GREEN)Text$(NC)"  # Works with plain echo!
```

## Impact

**Files Modified:**
- `Makefile` - Fix all color definitions and echo commands

**Breaking Changes:**
- None (cosmetic fix only)

**Benefits:**
- [YES] Colors render correctly on all systems
- [YES] Clean, professional Makefile output
- [YES] Consistent behavior across macOS/Linux
- [YES] Better readability of help text
- [YES] No more visible escape codes

**Risks:**
- None (cosmetic change only)

**Testing:**
- Test on macOS (zsh, bash)
- Verify colors render correctly
- Ensure no regression in functionality
