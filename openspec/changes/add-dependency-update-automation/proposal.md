# Dependency Update Automation

## Why

Dependencies like Homebrew packages, Python packages, and shell utilities require manual tracking and updating. This leads to outdated dependencies, security vulnerabilities, and maintenance burden.

## What Changes

- Add automated dependency update checker
- Implement GitHub Actions workflow for weekly dependency scans
- Create automated pull request generation for updates
- Add dependency changelog and breaking change detection
- Support multiple package managers: Homebrew, pip, npm, gem

## Impact

- Affected specs: New capability `dependency-management`
- Affected code:
  - New: `bin/core/dependency-checker` utility
  - New: `.github/workflows/dependency-updates.yml`
  - New: `scripts/generate-dependency-pr.sh`
  - Modified: `packages/homebrew/Brewfile` with version pinning
  - New: `.dependency-config.json` for update policies
