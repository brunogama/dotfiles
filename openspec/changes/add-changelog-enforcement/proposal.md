# Add CHANGELOG Enforcement Through Pre-Commit Hooks

## Why

Currently, the project has no systematic way to track user-facing changes. This causes:

**Problems:**

- [NO] No clear change history for users
- [NO] No way to know what changed between versions
- [NO] Contributors forget to document changes
- [NO] Release notes must be manually compiled
- [NO] Hard to track breaking changes

**Impact:**

- Users surprised by breaking changes
- Difficult onboarding (what's new?)
- Manual work for release documentation
- Lost track of important changes

**Current State:**

- No CHANGELOG.md file
- No pre-commit hooks configured
- Changes only documented in git commits
- No enforcement of change documentation

## What Changes

**Add CHANGELOG Management:**

- Create `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- Document existing changes from recent commits
- Establish semantic versioning conventions

**Add Pre-Commit Enforcement:**

- Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Add hook to verify CHANGELOG updates on commits
- Configure hook to check [Unreleased] section has new entries
- Allow bypass for non-user-facing changes (chore, docs)

**Workflow Integration:**

- Update CONTRIBUTING.md with CHANGELOG guidelines
- Add examples of good changelog entries
- Document pre-commit setup in README
- Add CHANGELOG link to README

## Impact

**Files Created:**

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Structured change log following Keep a Changelog format
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook configuration
- `scripts/validate-changelog.sh` - Custom validation script

**Files Modified:**

- `README.md` - Add CHANGELOG section and pre-commit setup instructions
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if exists) - Add CHANGELOG guidelines
- `.gitignore` - Ensure pre-commit cache is ignored

**Breaking Changes:**

- None (new workflow addition)

**Benefits:**

- [YES] Automatic change documentation
- [YES] Clear user-facing change history
- [YES] Easy release note generation
- [YES] Better communication with users
- [YES] Systematic tracking of breaking changes
- [YES] Enforced documentation at commit time

**Risks:**

- Low - Pre-commit can be bypassed with `--no-verify` if needed
- Learning curve for contributors (mitigated by good docs)
