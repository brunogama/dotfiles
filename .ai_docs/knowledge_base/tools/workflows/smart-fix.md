Intelligently fix the issue using automatic agent selection with explicit Task tool invocations:

\[Extended thinking: This workflow analyzes the issue and automatically routes to the most appropriate specialist
agent(s). Complex issues may require multiple agents working together.\]

First, analyze the issue to categorize it, then use Task tool with the appropriate agent:

## Analysis Phase

Examine the issue: "$ARGUMENTS" to determine the problem domain.

## Agent Selection and Execution

### For Deployment/Infrastructure Issues

If the issue involves deployment failures, infrastructure problems, or DevOps concerns:

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="devops-troubleshooter"
- Prompt: "Debug and fix this deployment/infrastructure issue: $ARGUMENTS"

### For Code Errors and Bugs

If the issue involves application errors, exceptions, or functional bugs:

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="debugger"
- Prompt: "Analyze and fix this code error: $ARGUMENTS. Provide root cause analysis and solution."

### For Database Performance

If the issue involves slow queries, database bottlenecks, or data access patterns:

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="database-optimizer"
- Prompt: "Optimize database performance for: $ARGUMENTS. Include query analysis, indexing strategies, and schema
  improvements."

### For Application Performance

If the issue involves slow response times, high resource usage, or performance degradation:

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="performance-engineer"
- Prompt: "Profile and optimize application performance issue: $ARGUMENTS. Identify bottlenecks and provide optimization
  strategies."

### For Legacy Code Issues

If the issue involves outdated code, deprecated patterns, or technical debt:

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="legacy-modernizer"
- Prompt: "Modernize and fix legacy code issue: $ARGUMENTS. Provide migration path and updated implementation."

## Multi-Domain Coordination

For complex issues spanning multiple domains:

1. Use primary agent based on main symptom
1. Use secondary agents for related aspects
1. Coordinate fixes across all affected areas
1. Verify integration between different fixes
